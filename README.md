Hey, I'm Jake (prounouns: he/him)! I'm currently working on the server side of the IT business, but have been interested in development for quite some time!

I'm a:
- Open source fanboy
- Docker nerd
- Unabashed Linux weirdo

Presently, the primary languages I code in are:
- Python
- Bash

However, I'm either learning or planning to learn:
- Javascript
- Rust

I'm also looking at getting into the HTML and CSS side of web design, but right now I really enjoy what static site generators like Zola or Ghost do for me, so that might come later down the line.

Most of the code here is stuff I'm writing as I take various online courses or read through coding manuals. I'm happy to hear any feedback you might have if you can see a way to improve on what I've written!
